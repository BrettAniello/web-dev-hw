System fonts are fonts hosted from a local device/system. Web fonts are hosted on a server, but require certain elements to get called up correctly. Web-safe fonts are fonts that developers can rely on to be available on both Windows and Mac systems.
font fallback and font stacks are important because the browser may not be able to load the primary font selected.
For this assignment I read the assignment page, found the material I would be using for my website, and then watched the walkthrough video. after that I worked through the assignment referring to the video and previous work when needed.
