My imaginary client was myself. I created a website for my photography Instagram page, and used other photographers websites as inspiration.
display:inline only takes up as much space as needed, and ignores width properties. inline-block forces elements to respect margin and vertical properties. Block is often used to create vertical menus out of lists.
For this assignment I read the assignment page, watched the walkthrough video, and referred to my past works to complete the site.
