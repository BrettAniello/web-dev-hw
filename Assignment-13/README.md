Coming into this class I knew nothing about web dev. I learned so much, and it was not at all what I was expecting. It was nice to learn all the different tools in coding and how to put them all together to build a functioning website. I also didn't know programs like Atom or Github existed, and it will be cool to use them in the future to refine my skills for free.
I liked learning how to incorporate media, and photos into a website. Being colorblind I have sometimes had difficulty utilizing colors but it wa nice to apply different color schemes into my websites. I have always enjoyed photography and things like interior design so it was nice to apply the interests to a completely different medium.
For this assignment I took most of my content from Assignment 12 and applied it in a different way. I first made the side navigation bar, then added in my content. I am extremely pleased with how it came out and like the outcome much better than Assignment 12.
