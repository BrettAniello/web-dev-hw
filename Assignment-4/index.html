  <h1>Fire and Ice</h1>
  <h2>Robert Frost</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>Some say the world will end in fire,Some say in ice. From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire I hold with those who favor fire. But if it had to perish twice, I think I know enough of hate To say that for destruction ice Is also great Is also great And would suffice.
